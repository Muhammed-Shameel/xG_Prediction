Skills & Techniques Used

This project applies various machine learning and data science techniques to predict Expected Goals (xG) in football matches. The following skills are demonstrated in the Python code:

1. Data Processing & Feature Engineering
-Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation and preprocessing.
-Feature Engineering – Creating new variables like shot angle, distance from goal.
-Categorical Encoding – Converting non-numeric data into machine-readable format.
2. Machine Learning Models
-Random Forest – Ensemble learning for baseline performance.
-XGBoost – Gradient boosting model for improved accuracy.
-LightGBM – Optimized boosting method for large datasets.
-Scikit-learn – Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
3. Model Evaluation & Metrics
-Mean Absolute Error (MAE) – Measures prediction accuracy.
-Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) – Penalizes larger errors.
-R² Score – Explains model performance.
4. Model Interpretability (SHAP Analysis)
-SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) – Understanding feature importance.
-Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn – Plotting results and insights.

Python Libraries Used
-pandas, numpy
-scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm
-shap, matplotlib, seaborn
